# Functional-Annotation-of-genes
This repository contains an R script that uses the NCBI Entrez (rentrez) API to map LOC gene identifiers to corresponding gene symbols and functional descriptions. The script was applied to resistance-associated genes identified from DEG and WGCNA overlap analysis in Plutella xylostella.
